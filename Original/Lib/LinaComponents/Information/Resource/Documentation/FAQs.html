<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Who is developing Lina Components?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Lina Components is being developed by several people, giving their input by ideas, code and help. The current maintainer of this (official) release is Dennis Göhlert. For a complete list of contributors see: </span><a class="rvts11" href="Credits.html">Credits</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">What license does Lina Components use?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Lina Components is available under </span><span class="rvts17">Mozilla Public License</span><span class="rvts6"> (MPL) 2.0. This means, it is completely open-source and available for everyone. Everyone can use, copy or modify the code, even for commercial purposes, as long as the license terms are not violated. For detailed information about the license see: </span><a class="rvts11" href="License.html">License</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">How can I contribute to Lina Components?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">There are different ways of how you can contribute to Lina Components. First, it is not important what you contribute: ideas, reports and criticism are as welcome as code snippets, fixes or improvements. Please verify that you do not violate other copyrights when sending us code or media. Also, make sure the code is interesting for being used by more than one person. The second step is then to contact us. There, please provide a valid reason and references (if necessary) in the case you are contributing new stuff. When sending code, it is also necessary to explicitly grant me the right to publish it under MPL 2.0. In this case, I will also check your code for functionality, compatibility and quality (for more information about what code quality means, see: </span><a class="rvts15" href="http://other.dennis07.de/CodeQuality.htm" target="_blank">http://other.dennis07.de/CodeQuality.html</a><span class="rvts6">). For contact information see: </span><a class="rvts11" href="Contact.html">Contact</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">How can I give a donation?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Donations are always welcome. For that, we have a donation page on Patreon. There, you can give me and the project a little thank if it helped you, if you like it or if it saved some of your or your company's work time. Lina Components is free and open-source, but still more powerful than many paid alternatives. To achieve that, it takes tens of thousands of hours of work time to improve it continuously. I and all contributors thank you for your more or less little part to keep Lina Components up-to-date!</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you are interested in donating, feel free to visit the Patreon page: </span><a class="rvts15" href="http://www.patreon.com/dennis07" target="_blank">http://www.patreon.com/dennis07</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Why is there no documentation for ...?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">As I already said in the </span><a class="rvts15" href="Introduction.html">introduction</a><span class="rvts6">, this help file is not a complete documentation for all methods, classes, objects and properties of Lina Components. Allot of those are still missing, because they are mostly irrelevant or because I didn't have the time to write a complete documentation here. For some, there exist a more or less good code documentation in the unit file, for some there is simply no documentation available, yet.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you think there is something really important missing in this documentation of if you are willing to contribute a documentation for something, please let me know. You can use the contact details written on the </span><a class="rvts11" href="Contact.html">Contact</a><span class="rvts6"> page for that.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Why is there only an English documentation?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Well, let me say it like this: I am from Germany and I speak German and English. This means I had the choice whether I write one, detailed monolingual documentation or two, less detailed documentations in different languages. And as most of you probably do not speak German better than any other language in the world (except you are from Germany), my decision was to only produce an English language version of it for first. If you want to translate this file into your mother language, it would be a pleasure for me to support you with that wherever I can. In this case, you can use the contact information written on the </span><a class="rvts11" href="Contact.html">Contact</a><span class="rvts6"> page. But I personally have enough to do with the code itself and this, English documentation.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Why do I need to have Indy installed?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Indy library for Delphi is necessary for come components which use an internet connection. This might be done in downloads or when sending or receiving protocols. If Indy is not installed on your Delphi and you do not have the chance to obtain it, some functionalities may not be used or be limited.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">To download the latest version of Indy, visit the project page at: </span><a class="rvts15" href="http://www.indyproject.org/" target="_blank">http://www.indyproject.org/</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Why do I need to have PascalScript installed?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The RemObjects PascalScript package has to be installed and correctly configured to use the script-based components. If RemObjects PascalScript is not installed, please obtain the latest version from </span><a class="rvts15" href="http://www.remobjects.com/" target="_blank">http://www.remobjects.com/</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">I need a modified version of ..., can you help?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The MPL 2.0 license allows you to use the code almost without any limitations. This means you can modify it and use it for your personal purposes, as long as you do not violate any license terms (for detailed information about the license see: </span><a class="rvts11" href="License.html">License</a><span class="rvts6">). If you have useful suggestions or if you created a useful addition, feel free to send it to me. But if you need a personal customization of a class or method, I cannot help you with that for free. Please have understanding for that, because I get lots of questions, requests and other stuff and I cannot give any personal support for a free and open-source product.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">What Delphi versions are supported?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Lina Components officially supports Delphi 7 up to Delphi XE7. For a detailed list of supported versions see: </span><a class="rvts11" href="Manual.html">Manual</a><span class="rvts6">. Lazarus and other FreePascal compilers is currently not officially supported. Also, 64 bit applications and FireMonkey are not fully integrated in Lina Components, yet.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps5"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts14">Why are some basic methods written in ASM?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">I decided to do that, because I noticed that the ASM equivalent is being executed almost three times faster than the standard pascal-only alternative. However, pure-pascal code alternatives are available and also provided. Currently, only one unit uses assembly code and I still try to avoid it where it is not useful.</span></p>
